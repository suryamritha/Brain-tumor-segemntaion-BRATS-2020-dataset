Automated brain tumor segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scansis very important in the timely diagnosis and precision treatment of patients, and has led to improved accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging. Several DL based techniques have been developed for this purpose and they are capable of extracting important features from the MRI scan. Hence,  the paper develops a Vision transformer and U-Net model based novel architecture (UNet-VT) for automated tumor segmentation using the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) 2020 dataset. Various other latest models have also been trained to give accurate segmentation for comparative performance. The findings contribute to enhancing clinical and research applications by providing precise tumor segmentation. This helps in personalized patient care, ensuring treatment can be modifiedbased on some particular characteristics of each tumor. In terms of overall performance, UNet-VT stands out with extremely good performance having the best Dice coefficient = 80.45% and the best mean IOU=89.5%, making it one of the top models for brain tumor segmentation.These results demonstrate enhanced segmentation precision and reliability, which are crucial for personalized treatment planning, making it a valuable tool for both clinical and research applications.
